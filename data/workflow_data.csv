8830730,69238,1,New Customer created in QuickBooks Online will create client in Replicon,"This recipe transfers customers in QuickBooks to Replicon, working under the assumption that QuickBooks is the master system for client data and has the most updated information. This is useful when Replicon is your project management system that consolidates timesheets and expenses in a central system, while QuickBooks Online is your accounting system.

!! Do note that QuickBooks will overwrite data in Replicon in this recipe, so turn it on only if QuickBooks is the master system with the most updated client data.


#### How it works

Trigger: New customers created in the last 30 minutes in QuickBooks will be picked up by the recipe when it is first started. Subsequently, new customers created in QuickBooks will be picked up while the recipe is running.

Actions:
- If client already exists in Replicon, the recipe will still sync the data from QuickBooks to Replicon and update the Replicon client data.
- If client does not exist in Replicon, it will be created
- If client is inactive in Replicon, its status will be changed back to active and it will be overwritten with the new data from QuickBooks
- For the Replicon 'Country' input field, we use a lookup table (in formula mode) to convert QuickBook's freeform text values for 'Country' conform to Replicon's picklist values for 'Country'


#### Customization Options
- You can customise the data that gets transferred from QuickBooks to Replicon


#### What you need to use this recipe
- You should have a Replicon account with integrations rights and the Billing Manager permission set, as well as a Quickbooks Online account with Company Administrator rights.

Usually used with: 
- Sync new invoice in Replicon to QuickBooks Online - QuickBooks is master system
- Sync QuickBooks Online invoice status to Replicon",2019-01-28T07:38:23.455-08:00,2019-01-28T07:38:23.455-08:00,"{quickbooks,replicon}","{Accounting,""Time and Expense""}","{customer,client}",FALSE,FALSE,0,0,10359

This is useful when Replicon is your timesheet management system that consolidates timesheets and expenses in a central system, while QuickBooks Online is your accounting system.


#### How it works
Trigger: Invoices with the Sync Status marked as `Queued for Sync` in Replicon will be picked up and processed by the recipe.

Actions:
- In QuickBooks, search for the customer the invoice is billed to. If the customer does not currently exist in QuickBooks, proceed to create the customer in QuickBooks if Replicon is the master.
- Create the invoice header in QuickBooks with the first invoice line item.
- For each of the lists of time, fixed bids and expenses, iterate through the lists to bring invoice line items from Replicon into the QuickBooks invoice.
- Finally, return to Replicon to update the invoice's External ID field with the corresponding QuickBooks invoice number

#### What you need to use this recipe
- You should have a Replicon account with integrations rights and the Billing Manager permission set, as well as a Quickbooks Online account with Company Administrator rights. For the actions to add line items to QuickBooks, the Item name must be the name of an Inventory item in your QuickBooks account.

This is useful when Replicon is your project management system that consolidates timesheets and expenses in a central system, while QuickBooks Online is your accounting system.

Also, this recipe keeps the due date of the invoices in sync - updated due dates on QuickBooks invoices will update the due date on Replicon invoices correspondingly.


#### How it works

Trigger: Invoices updated since a day ago in QuickBooks will be picked up at the start of the recipe. Subsequently, updated invoices will continue to be picked up by the recipe.

Actions:
- Update due date of Replicon invoice if it has been changed in QuickBooks.
- If QuickBooks' email status is equal to 'EmailSent' and the outstanding balance is more than 0, then set the Replicon invoice status as Billed. If QuickBooks' email status is equal to 'EmailSent' and the outstanding balance is 0, then set the Replicon invoice status as Paid.
