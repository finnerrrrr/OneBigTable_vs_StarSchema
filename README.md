# ðŸ“Š Data Modelling Case Study

Data modelling is a crucial part of a Data Engineer's role. To gain hands-on experience, I worked with a fictitious dataset to design a schema, perform data ingestion, transformation, and load it into a relational database.

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ data/               # Raw and processed data files
â”œâ”€â”€ sql/                # SQL scripts for schema, transformations
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks or exploratory scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt    # Python dependencies (if any)
```

## Objectives 

- Design an efficient and scalable relational data model

- Simulate ETL process (Extract, Transform, Load)

- Apply normalization principles and best practices

- Load structured data into the final schema using SQL
